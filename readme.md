## Setup Instructions (Local Development)

### 1. Clone the Repos

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coderaccangus/Hamperly

```

### 2. Backend Setup

```
cd hamperly-backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # fill in MONGODB_URI and JWT_SECRET
npm run seed:admin      
npm run seed:users
npm run seed:hampers

```
### 3. Backend Setup
```
cd hamperly-frontend
npm install

```
### Testing

You can use tools like Insomnia or Postman to test backend endpoints like:

    POST /api/users/register

    POST /api/users/login

    GET /api/orders/my-orders (requires JWT)

    POST /api/orders (requires JWT)

Admin routes:

    GET /api/admin/users

    GET /api/admin/orders

    PUT /api/orders/:id â€“ Update status

### Mail Service

The standalone mail service is hosted here:
ðŸ‘‰ https://hamperly-mail-service.onrender.com

While not fully integrated into the production app, it's working independently and ready for use when needed (e.g., for order confirmations or welcome emails).

Mail Service routes:

    POST  https://hamperly-mail-service.onrender.com/send
    
    {
  "to": "test@example.com",
  "subject": "Hamperly Render Email Test",
  "text": "This is a test email sent from Render!"
    }


### Future Improvements

    Full integration of the mail service for notifications

    Stripe or PayPal checkout integration

    User profile editing

    Advanced filtering and analytics for admins

    Mobile responsiveness and UI polish
